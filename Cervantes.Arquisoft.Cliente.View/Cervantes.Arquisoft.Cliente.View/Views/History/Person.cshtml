<p>
    One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself
    transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like
    back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly,
    slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was
    hardly able to cover <strong>strong</strong> it and seemed ready to slide
    off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of
    the rest of him, <a class="external ext" href="#">link</a> waved about
    helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he thought. It wasn't a
    dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay
    peacefully between its four familiar walls.
